# Universality-Einstein-QED
In this repository is available the Mathematica notebook and the model needed to compute the diagrams of the work "Universality of gauge coupling constant in the Einstein-QED system". The work is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12732

The model has two files: Einstein_QED_2.gen and Einstein_QED_2.mod. Both are in the compressed file Einstein_QED_2. The computations are in the Mathematica notebook QED_Gravity.nb.
